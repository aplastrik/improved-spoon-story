Once upon a time there was a spoon named Jack who lived in a castle.

Everyday, people in the castle had been using it to have meals.
Everyone thought Jack was a really good spoon and the maids had been taking very good care of it.
However, the liitle prince Tom wasn't really a fan of Jack, because her mother always used it to feed him the carrot soup which he didn't like at all.
So, one day in the night, Tom sneaked into the kitchen, stole the spoon, and threw it away from the highest tower in the castle.

On the second day, his mother canâ€™t find the spoon. Therefore, she asked Tom, but Tom said he had no idea the spoon.
Later, his mother gave up looking for the spoon. Then Tome never drinks the carrot soup.
