Once upon a time there was a spoon named Jack who lived in a castle.

Everyday, people in the castle had been using it to have meals.
Everyone thought Jack was a really good spoon and the maids had been taking very good care of it.
However, the liitle prince Tom wasn't really a fan of Jack, because her mother always used it to feed him the carrot soup which he didn't like at all.
So, one day in the night, Tom sneaked into the kitchen, stole the spoon, and threw it away from the highest tower in the castle.

On the second day, his mother canâ€™t find the spoon. Therefore, she asked Tom, but Tom said he had no idea the spoon.
Later, his mother gave up looking for the spoon. Then Tome never drinks the carrot soup.

Tom was happy at first, but he starteed to feel guilty.
After a week without Jack, Tom told his mom everything.
He told her that he threw Jack out the window because he didnt want to eat carrot soup.
His mom told him that if he didn't like carrot soup, he didn't have to eat it.
She went and found Jack outside and used him to feed Tom pea soup instead of carrot soup.
Tom loved pea soup and was very happy that Jack was back.
Everybody lived happily ever after.

However, Tom's mom bought another spoon named Jerry. They never know that 
those spoons have lives every midnight. Both Jerry and Jack wanted to be 
Tom's only spoon, do they have fought every night and decided who has the 
right to be Tom's only one. One day, Jerry threw Jack down the tower again, 
and Jack had never been found then.
